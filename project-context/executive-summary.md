## The Opportunity

DataOps and MLOps teams are drowning in manual ticket creation, spending **2-3 hours per day** per Project Manager writing JIRA tickets. This represents **30-40% of their productive capacity** lost to repetitive administrative work.

### The Business Problem

| Issue | Current Impact | Annual Cost (per PM) |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Manual ticket creation | 2-3 hours/day wasted | **$30-45K** in lost productivity |
| Scattered requests | 5-10% requests missed/lost | **$5-10K** in rework and delays |
| No analytics | Unable to optimize or forecast | **$10-15K** in inefficiency |
| Context loss | Repeated clarifications, delays | **$15-20K** in overhead |
| **TOTAL COST** | | **$60-90K per PM annually** |

**For a team with 5 PMs, this represents $300-450K in annual productivity losses.**

---

## The Solution: JIRA DataOps Agent
